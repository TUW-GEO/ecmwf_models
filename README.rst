Readers and converters for ECMWF reanalysis (`ERA5 <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels>`_
and `ERA5-Land <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-land>`_) data.
Written in Python.

Works great in combination with `pytesmo <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/pytesmo>`_.


Installation
============

Install required C-libraries via conda. For installation we recommend
`Miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_:

.. code::

    conda install -c conda-forge pygrib netcdf4 pyresample pykdtree

Afterwards the following command will install all remaining python dependencies
as well as the ``ecmwf_models`` package itself.

.. code::

    pip install ecmwf_models

Quickstart
==========

Download image data from CDS using the ``era5 download`` and ``era5land download``
shell command (see ``era5 download --help`` for all options) ...

.. code-block:: shell

    era5land download /tmp/era5/img -s 2024-04-01 -e 2024-04-05 -v swvl1,swvl2 --h_steps 0,12

... and convert them to time series (ideally for a longer period). Check ``era5 reshuffle --help``

.. code-block:: shell

    era5land reshuffle /tmp/era5/img /tmp/era5/ts 2024-04-01 2024-04-05 --land_points True

Finally, in python, read the time series data for a location as a pandas
DataFrame.

.. code-block:: python

    >> from ecmwf_models.interface import ERATs
    >> ds = ERATs('/tmp/era5/ts')
    >> ds.read(18, 48)  # (lon, lat)

                            swvl1     swvl2
    2024-04-01 00:00:00  0.318054  0.329590
    2024-04-01 12:00:00  0.310715  0.325958
    2024-04-02 00:00:00  0.360229  0.323502
            ...             ...       ...
    2024-04-04 12:00:00  0.343353  0.348755
    2024-04-05 00:00:00  0.350266  0.346558
    2024-04-05 12:00:00  0.343994  0.344498

More programs are available to keep an exisiting image and time series record
up-to-date. Type ``era5 --help`` and ``era5land --help`` to see all available
programs.

CDS API Setup
=============

In order to download data from CDS, this package uses the CDS API
(https://pypi.org/project/cdsapi/). You can either pass your credentials
directly on the command line (which might be unsafe) or set up a
.cdsapirc file in your home directory (recommended).
Please see the description at https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/how-to-api.

Supported Products
==================

At the moment this package supports

- **ERA5**
- **ERA5-Land**

reanalysis data in **grib** and **netcdf** format (download, reading, time
series creation) with a default spatial sampling of 0.25 degrees (ERA5),
and 0.1 degrees (ERA5-Land).
It should be easy to extend the package to support other ECMWF reanalysis
products. This will be done as need arises.

Docker image
============

We provide a docker image for this package. This contains all
pre-installed dependencies and can simply be pulled via

.. code-block:: shell

    $ docker pull ghcr.io/tuw-geo/ecmwf_models:latest

Alternatively, to build the image locally using the Dockerfile, call

.. code-block:: shell

    $ docker build ecmwf_models:latest . 2>&1 | tee docker_build.log

Afterwards, you can execute the ``era5`` and ``era5land`` commands directly in
the container (after mounting some volumes to write data to).
The easiest way to set the API credentials in this case is via the environment
variable or the ``--cds_token`` option.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ docker run -v /data/era5/img:/container/path ecmwf_models:latest bash -c \
       'era5land update_img /container/path --cds_token xxxx-xxx-xxx-xx-xxxx'

You can use this together with a task scheduler to regularly pull new data
